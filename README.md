# Built with React.js

This is my portfolio, and I had the pleasure of using React.js, Bootstrap, and NES.css to build it. To check out NES.css (an awesome retro gaming framework) go to https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/

If you like the typing effect on the main screen, feel free to use it yourself. You can get it here-https://github.com/DJolley12/Javascript-Typing-Effect
